        <h2>The Me in Music</h3>
        <p>
            To be honest, My life is inseparable from music.<br>
            Music allows me to focus on my own things, reduce my attention to the outside world, and improve my work and study efficiency.<br>
            So here, I am willing to show you my music preferences.
        </p>

                <p>Huhh, it's crazy that I've listened to his songs for over 700 hours, right?<br>
                   The song "Fate Stay Night", which is composed by him, has become my favourite song of 2024.
                   You can enjoy that now.

        <p >
            Besides my passion for music, I am also a game enthusiast.<br>
            I play many games, both PC and mobile. The types involved are also very diverse, including visual novels, puzzle solving, FPS, cards, tower defense, etc.<br>
            However, among various games, the one I spend the most time on is a game called <strong>Clash Royale</strong>.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Game Introduction</h2>
            <p>Clash Royale is a mobile game developed by Finnish game company Supercell, featuring real-time strategy, MOBA, and card elements. It was released on January 4, 2016. The game is based on the characters and worldview of Clash of Clans. In the game, players need to enhance their combat power by continuously opening treasure chests to obtain cards, and then engage in matching battles with other online players.

            <h3>Me and this game...</h3>
            <img src="/img/cr_rank.jpg" alt="Failed to load the picture" class = "cr_rank">
            <img src="/img/cr_rank_local.jpg" alt="Failed to load the picture" class = "cr_rank">
            <p>I have been playing this game since the server was launched, and I have been playing it for 9 years now. I am also one of the oldest players of this game. At first, I played with my friends in elementary school, but now I am the only one who still insists on playing this game. In 9 years, apart from living and going to school, I can't think of anything else that would cost me more time than playing this game. Fortunately, I have also achieved some success in the game during these 9 years. My ranking on the ladder now is shown in the picture. Even if I am not a top player, I can still feel fun from the game. Every prediction of the opponent's actions is exciting.
            <br><br>It is worth mentioning that Royal War was once among the top three global esports mobile games. Players are immersed in every moment of esports competitions, and I am no exception. In the past, I was also one of the supporters of the W.EDGM team and its core player Higher. However, with the changing times and the influence of various factors, competitions have shifted from team based to individual based, and many professional players from the past have gradually disappeared from the public eye. Although many top players such as Mohamed Light and Ryley have contributed many exciting operations, the overall level of excitement in the game is not as high as before. In the past 2024 Royal War Global Finals, Chinese player <strong style = "color:blue">Lciop</strong> was the only player to defeat champion Light. Only seasoned veterans have left scars on the face of the new king.

            <p>In fact, I also participated in game competitions organized spontaneously by the public. Just this past April, I participated in the Clash Royale Chinese University League and teamed up with my captain to compete in the 2v2 project.
                Our creative attempts combined with delicate operations have made us invincible. And the video on the right is the best proof.<br>
                </p>
            </p>
                Due to space limitations and personal abilities, I can only showcase so much. But I believe you already have a general understanding of what kind of person I am, that's enough.
